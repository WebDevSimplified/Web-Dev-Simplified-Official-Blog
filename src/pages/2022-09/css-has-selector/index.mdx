If you have ever tried to create complex CSS styles most likely you have run into the need to style a parent element based on the child elements inside it. This is such a common use case to run into, but CSS has never had a way to do this and honestly I never thought they would implement a way to do this, but just recently CSS released the `:has` selector which does all of this and more.

## What Is The `:has` Selector?

The `:has` selector is a pseudo class similar to `:hover` and `:focus`, but it works very similar to the `:is` and `:not` pseudo classes if you are familiar with those. In order to use the `:has` selector you need to pass a selector (or list of selectors) to the `:has` selector which will be applied to the parent element. This sounds confusing in words so let me show you an example.

```css
.heading:has(.subtitle) {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

This simple selector says that we should select any element with the class of `.heading` which contains an element with the class `.subtitle` inside it and apply a special margin on the bottom. This means we are able to set the margin on the bottom of our `.heading` to 1rem based on the elements inside the `.heading`.

```html
<h1 class="heading">
  <!-- SELECTED -->
  <span class="subtitle"></span>
</h1>

<h1 class="heading"></h1>
<!-- NOT SELECTED -->
```

If you are familiar with CSS this may seem really backwards since normally in CSS you can only select the last element in a list, but the `:has` pseudo element allows us to check for the existence of elements inside other elements while still selecting the actual parent element that we care about.

## Advanced Usage

The above example we talked about shows the most straightforward way to use the `:has` selector, but you can actually do quite a bit more with it.

### Using Complex Selectors

Instead of just passing a single class to the `:has` selector we can actually pass any selector we want.

```css
.heading:has(> .subtitle strong#accent) {
}
```

This much more complex selector still works just fine and will select any `.heading` element that has a direct child with the class of `subtitle` which contains a `strong` element in it with the id of `accent`.

### More Than Just A Parent Selector

So far all the examples we have talked about have shown you how to use this selector as a parent selector, but it can do so much more than that.

```css
.heading:has(.subtitle) p {
}
```

This selector will select any p tag that is inside a `.heading` element as long as that `.heading` element contains a `.subtitle` element. By utilizing our `:has` selector in the middle of our selector we can create some incredibly complex selectors that can achieve things that I never thought would be possible in CSS.

### Using Multiple Selectors

You can also combine together multiple selectors in your `:has` selector to check for some truly complex stuff.

```css
.heading:has(.subtitle, p) {
}

.heading:has(.subtitle):has(p) {
}
```

The above lines of code look similar but they actually check for different things. The first selector will select a `.heading` that has either an element with the class of `subtitle` inside it or a `p` element inside it while the second selector will only select a `.heading` that has both a `.subtitle` and `p` element inside it.

## Specificity

Calculating specificity with the `:has` selector is a bit complex compared to a normal pseudo class. _If you unfamiliar with how CSS specificity is calculated check out my [ultimate CSS specificity guide](/2020-02/css-specificity)._

When you just use a single `:has` selector and only have one selector inside it the specificity is easy to calculate since you just combine the specificity of the `:has` selector with the specificity of the outside selector.

```css
.heading:has(.subtitle p) {
}
```

This selector has a specificity of 1 class outside the `:has` selector and a specificity of 1 class and 1 element inside the `:has` selector which means overall the specificity of the selector is 2 classes and 1 element. It would be the same specificity as the below code.

```css
h1.heading.blue {
}
```

The specificity gets a bit more complex when dealing with multiple selectors in one `:has`.

```css
.heading:has(.subtitle, p) {
}
```

You may think this will have the same specificity as the above example, but when you pass multiple selectors (separated by a comma) to `:has` it only uses the specificity of the most specific selector. That means since the `.subtitle` selector is more specific than the `p` selector the specificity inside the `:has` selector will be just 1 class so the overall specificity of this selector is 2 classes and is equivalent to the below code.

```css
.heading.blue {
}
```

Finally, this gets even more complex when dealing with multiple `:has` selectors. Each `:has` selector will calculate its own specificity and you combine them all with the overall specificity of the selector.

```css
.heading:has(.subtitle):has(p) {
}
```

This selector has an overall specificity of 2 classes and 1 element since the first `:has` selector has a specificity of 1 class and the second `:has` selector has a specificity of 1 element. Those specificities are then all combined with the specificity of the code outside the `:has` selectors which is 1 class to give you an overall specificity of 2 classes and 1 element.

## Browser Support

The `:has` selector is supported in all major browsers as of the end of 2023.

## Conclusion

A parent selector is something I have been hoping for in CSS for years and now that it is finally here I am incredibly excited. Not only that, but the implementation they created is even better than just a plain parent selector. I cannot wait for this to have good browser support.
