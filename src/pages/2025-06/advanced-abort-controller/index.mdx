## Introduction

If you have made API requests then you have probably used `AbortController` to cancel `fetch` requests that are no longer needed. This is especially popular in frameworks like React.

What you probably didn't know, though, is that this is only a small percentage of what `AbortController` can do, and in this article I will be covering all the amazing features of `AbortController` that nearly no one knows.

## The Basics of `AbortController`

_Before we dive into the advanced features I do need to cover the basics so feel free to skip this section if you are already familiar with `AbortController`._

The `AbortController` API works by creating a `signal` that you can pass to certain JavaScript functions. This `signal` tells the function if it should continue or abort. In order to abort a function you just need to call `controller.abort()`, and any function that is listening to that signal will stop what it is doing.

```js
const controller = new AbortController()
const signal = controller.signal

fetch("/api/data", { signal })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => {
    if (err.name === "AbortError") {
      console.log("Request was aborted")
    } else {
      throw err
    }
  })

// Cancel the request
controller.abort()
```

Fetch requests are the most common use case for `AbortController`, but it can be used with any API that supports the `signal` option.

## `AbortController` With Event Listeners

You can also use `AbortController` to remove event listeners.

```js
const controller = new AbortController()
const signal = controller.signal

window.addEventListener("resize", () => console.log("Resized"), {
  signal,
})

// Later, this removes the listener
controller.abort()
```

When you create an event listener you can pass along a third parameter which is an options object. If you pass the `signal` property with the `AbortController`'s signal, then when you call `controller.abort()`, it will automatically remove the event listener as if you called `removeEventListener`.

This is especially useful in frameworks like React where you want to clean up event listeners from `useEffect`, or when you have many event listeners you want to remove at the same time.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  const signal = controller.signal

  window.addEventListener("dragstart", () => console.log("Drag started"), {
    signal,
  })
  window.addEventListener("dragend", () => console.log("Drag ended"), {
    signal,
  })

  return () => {
    // Removes all the listeners
    controller.abort()
  }
}, [])
```

## `AbortSignal` Built In Functions

The `AbortController` API also has some built-in functions that can make your life easier through the `AbortSignal` interface.

### `AbortSignal.timeout()`

One of the most underused features of `AbortController` is `AbortSignal.timeout()`, which creates a signal that automatically aborts after a timeout:

```js
const signal = AbortSignal.timeout(5000) // 5 seconds

fetch("/api/slow-endpoint", { signal }).catch(err => {
  if (err.name === "TimeoutError") {
    console.log("Request timed out")
  }
})
```

The above code creates a `fetch` request that will automatically abort after 5 seconds if it hasn't completed.

No longer do you need to manually handle timeouts with `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`.

## `AbortSignal.any()`

Another powerful feature is `AbortSignal.any()`, which allows you to create a signal that aborts when any of the provided signals are aborted:

```js
const controller = new AbortController()
const signal = AbortSignal.any(
  controller.signal,
  AbortSignal.timeout(3000), // 3 seconds
)
```

This is great if you want to combine a timeout and a manual abort signal. The request will be aborted if either the manual abort is called or the timeout is reached.

## `AbortSignal.abort()`

You can also create an `AbortSignal` that is already aborted using `AbortSignal.abort()`:

```js
const signal = AbortSignal.abort()
fetch("/api/data", { signal }).catch(err => {
  if (err.name === "AbortError") {
    console.log("Request was aborted")
  }
})
```

This is probably the least useful of the built-in functions, but it can be handy in certain situations.

## Create Your Own `AbortController` Enabled Functions

The true power in `AbortController` comes from the ability to create your own functions that support aborting. This allows you to build APIs that are cancelable, just like `fetch`.

Doing this is as simple as accepting a signal parameter in your function, checking if it has been aborted, and then listening for the abort event:

```js {3-7,9-13}
function doSomething(signal) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Is it already aborted?
    if (signal.aborted) {
      reject(signal.reason)
      return
    }

    // Listen for abort events
    signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
      clearTimeout(id)
      reject(signal.reason)
    })

    // Simulate a long-running operation
    const id = setTimeout(() => resolve("Did Something"), 5000)
  })
}
```

Making your own abortable API is as simple as that. You can now use this function with an `AbortController`.

```js
// Cancel the operation after 3 seconds
const signal = AbortSignal.timeout(3000)

doSomething(signal)
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(err => {
    if (err.name === "AbortError") {
      console.log("Operation was aborted")
    } else {
      throw err
    }
  })
```

Here is a simple function you can use to make abortable functions easier.

```js
function makeAbortable(fn) {
  return signal => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if (signal.aborted) {
        reject(signal.reason)
        return
      }

      signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
        reject(signal.reason)
      })

      fn(resolve, reject, signal)
    })
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

`AbortController` is a powerful API that goes beyond just canceling `fetch` requests. It can be used to clean up event listeners, create timeout signals, and even build your own abortable functions.
